finds football match odds and compares with smarkets lay odds

odds scraper for arbitrage bets

- ~~smarkets works well,~~ smarkets has modified its website the day after I started scraping
their website and adds a delay before showing their odds so all odds come
back as empty :( coral scraping is dodgy and odds are unreliable, william hills broke too.

- basically eveythings broken now but thats just web scraping 4 u

- uses 888sport bet365 unibet api through [soccerapi](https://github.com/S1M0N38/soccerapi).

- bet365 is locked due to region I think.
